# Sass

Sass (syntactically awesome stylesheets) is a style sheet language. Helps to developer to work with CSS. CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.

#### Install Sass:

Sass is a Gem from Ruby, this means that it's necesary install Ruby before install Sass. After install Ruby, go to the terminal and write:

```bash
$sudo gem install sass
```
